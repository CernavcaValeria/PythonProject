Server-client application that simulates "Guess the Number" game.
The number to be guessed was in the range [0, 50]. There are 2 possibilities: either the number will be generated by the server or it will be given by another client - in case 2 people want to play. At each attempt to guess the number, the customer receives one of the messages: the number is correct / the number is smaller / larger than the chosen number. Each run of the script represents a game session, consisting of several game games.
At the end of the session, the maximum score is displayed - which is the lowest number of attempts required to find the number.
